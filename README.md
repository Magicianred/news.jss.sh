# news.sedders123.me

Hello! This repo generates my personal RSS feed. It's hosted at [news.sedders123.me](https://news.sedders123.me/). This project is a port of [news.jamesroutley.io](http://news.jamesroutley.io) to C# .NET Core.

## How does it work?

### Building the website

The RSS feed is generated by the script [Program.cs](/Program.cs). It:

1. Stores a list of RSS feeds
2. Fetches all the posts from each feed that were published in the last 2 months
3. Sorts the posts by publish time, and then uses a [Scriban](https://github.com/lunet-io/scriban) template to render an HTML file, which it writes to [docs/index.html](docs/index.html)

### Hosting the website

GitHub pages is used to host the site and its configured to serve the files in the [docs](/docs) directory.

### Automation

A GitHub [Action](/.github/workflows/build.yml) runs the project every hour. Any changes to `docs/index.html`, are committed and automatically deployed to GitHub Pages

## Contributing
